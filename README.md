# alu_regex-data-extraction-b-sandrine
This repository contains Regex codes Hackathon. This project, `alu_regex-data-extraction-b-sandrine`, implements a JavaScript script to extract and validate specific data types from text data aggregated by an API. The script uses Regular Expressions (regex) to identify and validate eight data types: email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, time, HTML tags, hashtags, and currency amounts. The goal is to process large datasets (e.g., web page content) and flag invalid data entries for further review.
